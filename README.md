# VisAnnotate - A Visual Annotation Tool

A tool to easily and dynamically add annotations to images.

My use case for this is to dive into open machine learning papers to gain better insight into cutting edge research. See my abandoned attempts to document notes in plain text at dahmad.github.io.

This is an addition to a series of toy projects to challenge me to learn new languages and frameworks.

For this project, I intend to target Python for both the back- and front ends. Batavia and brython are two active projects that transpile to JavaScript. The decision between these (and between Flask vs. Django) will be made soon. For front-end tests, I want to used Python Selenium bindings for the sake of consistency.
